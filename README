QUICK INSTALLATION AND RUN TEST
-------------------------------

Download the gzipped tarball, from the SOFTSUSY homepage 
http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/ for instance softsusy-3.2.tar.gz. Then,
type (on a linux box)

> tar -xvzf softsusy-3.2.tar.gz
> cd softsusy-3.2
> ./configure F77=gfortran
> make

which should compile the code. There are four C++ test programs, three of
which can be run by the commands 
> ./softsusy.x
> ./rpvsoftsusy.x 
> ./rpvneut.x
The output from these commands can be checked against outputTest,
rpvOutputTest and the RPV neutrino SOFTSUSY manual, respectively.

You can run the SUSY Les Houches Accord input provided by running the commands
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < lesHouchesInput
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < slha2Input
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < rpvHouchesInput
You may check the output of these commands against the output files
lesHouchesOutput, slha2Output and rpvHouchesOutput, respectively, that are
provided with the SOFTSUSY distribution

Alternatively, run with command line inputs, for example
> ./softpoint.x sugra 100 250 -100 10 unified 1 lambdaP 3 2 2 0.01
The output of this command is supplied in neutOutputTest

INTRODUCTION
------------

The most recent version of SOFTSUSY and full documentation can be obtained
from: http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/

This code provides a SUSY spectrum in the MSSM with or without R-parity
consistent with input low energy data, and a user supplied high energy
constraint (eg minmal SUGRA). It is written in C++ with an emphasis on easy
generalisability. Full three-family couplings and renormalisation group
equations are employed, as well as one-loop finite corrections a la Bagger,
Matchev, Pierce and Zhang. It can be used in conjunction with other programs
for many different particle physics calculations.

Comp. Phys. Comm. 143 (2002) 305, hep-ph/0104145, which is the SOFTSUSY
manual. If you use the R-parity violating aspects, please cite

The manuals on the electronic hep-ph/ archive will be updated with the most
recent version.
