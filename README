-------------------------------------------------


PREREQUISITES:
--------------

To include the three-loop running with leading two-loop thresholds for the strong coupling constant and the third generation of fermions within the MSSM

- pkg-config
- GiNaC 1.5 (with CLN)
- autogen 5.10

On Debian/Ubuntu system one can issue the following command to install 
the prerequsites:

sudo apt-get install pkg-config autogen libginac-dev

QUICK INSTALLATION AND RUN TEST
-------------------------------

Download the gzipped tarball, from the SOFTSUSY homepage 
http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/ for instance softsusy-3.5.0.tar.gz. Then,
type (on a linux box)

> tar -xvzf softsusy-3.5.0.tar.gz
> cd softsusy-3.5.0
> ./configure --enable-full_three_loop --enable-full_susy_threshold (These two flags force the inclusion of the full SUSY three-loop RGEs and two-loop threshold corrections to the strong coupling constant and third generation of fermions within the MSSM)  
> make
> make install

which should compile the code and run some sample commands. 
"make install" command is crucial for the evaluation of two-loop threshold effects, since corresponding two-loop expressions are stored in the form of GiNaC archive which could be found by main programs (e.g. softpoint.x) only if  ``make install'' is issued. After installation binary files can be found in PREFIX/bin where PREFIX is the installation prefix specified during configuration (PREFIX defaults to `/usr/local').

Additional configure switches:
 --enable-debug   A lot of debug printing (not related to original SOFTSUSY PRINTOUT option)
 --prefix         Where the installation is done. Notice that the binaries go into prefix/bin  

Since evaluation of two-loop decoupling corrections is rather a time-consuming process (especially thresholds for b-quark mass) they are not NOT turned on by default. Three-loop RGEs are also switched off.

There are five C++ test programs, four of which can be run by the commands 
> ./softsusy.x
> ./rpvsoftsusy.x 
> ./rpvneut.x
> ./softsusy-nmssm.x
The output from these commands can be checked against outputTest,
rpvOutputTest, neutOutputTest and respectively.

You can run the SUSY Les Houches Accord input provided by running the commands
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < lesHouchesInput
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < slha2Input
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < rpvHouchesInput
You may check the output of these commands against the output files
lesHouchesOutput, slha2Output and rpvHouchesOutput, respectively, that are
provided with the SOFTSUSY distribution

Alternatively, run with command line inputs, for example
> ./softpoint.x nmssm sugra --m0=125 --m12=125 --a0=-300 --tanBeta=10 --lambda=0.1 --lambdaAtMsusy

INTRODUCTION
------------

The most recent version of SOFTSUSY and full documentation can be obtained
from: http://softsusy.hepforge.org/

This program provides a SUSY spectrum in the MSSM including flavour violation
and with or without R-parity consistent with input Standard Model fermion
mass/mixings and electroweak/strong coupling data. The R-parity violating mode
now calculates neutrino masses and mixings to 1 loop. 
Since version 3.4, it also calculates in the NMSSM.
