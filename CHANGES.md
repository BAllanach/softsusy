* Bug-fixed neutralino1 decays: added missing CP-conjugate modes.
* Bug-fixed neutralino1 decay: minor change in identify of third fermion in ~chi_10 -> ~chi_1- u dbar.
* Fixed naming of antiparticles in decay output file: eg "db" -> "dbar". Also "~Zi -> ~chi_i0" where i is 1,2,3 or 4, and similar for ~Wi.
* Fixed naming of inos in comments of decay output file: reinstated the tilde which was missing in some cases.
