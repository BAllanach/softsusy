<li>Thanks to I Strumke for finding bugs leading to following:  Checking for negative PWs - All the partial widths are now checked to see if they are negative, if they are then a warning is output before the decay tables listing which mode is negative and setting its partial width to 0 so as not to result in Total branching ratios > 1.
<li>New formula for gluino 3 body decays to first generation quarks for the limit of very compressed spectra (or heavy intermediate squarks) - In the limit of extremely compressed spectra then numerical precision issues may arise due to very fine cancellations between quantities, previously for these very compressed decays of gluino to neutralino LSP uubar or ddbar (when the gluino is only 100MeV or so above the mass of the neutralino LSP) this occasionally led to negative PWs as the integrand varied between random positive and negative values reflecting numerical precision, and even for positive PWs accuracy was lost as the value reflected random positive values from numerical precision issues. We have now performed the cancellation analytically in this limit and coded in the remainder of the cancellation to allow the actual PWs to be evaluated. This is only important for extremely compressed spectra and when only these extremely compressed modes are available to the parent particle (otherwise non compressed modes will dominate anyway), we leave it to future study if there are similar scenarios in the neutralino and chargino 3 body decay.
<li>Limits corrected for gluino 3-body decays to charginos and quarks of the first two generations. The limits were missing some pieces proportional to mq or mqâ€™ for the first two generations, again these effects are minimal, extending or reducing the phase space available by very small amounts and doing so in regions very suppressed anyway. However, for very compressed spectra again this could cause nan issues (or negative PWs) as sqrts of negative numbers may be produced in the tiny regions where the previous limits of integration extended that are not actually in the real full expression limits of the integration.
<li>Tried to avoid issues with autotools on the Mac by clean/autoreconf cycle.
