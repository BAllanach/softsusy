<li> Slightly changed the calculation of the DRbar bottom mass - differs at the per mille level
<li> Added <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1617767">Himalaya</a> interface: three loop threshold corrections to Higgs mass. Thanks to R Harlander, J Klappert and A Voigt. See below for configuration options and use
<li> Added chargino->charged pion/neutralino decays for small mass splittings
<li> Split decays up into three files to allow faster compilation. Made a
decayTable object
<li> Fixed bug in decays numerics that was giving many NaN's from numerical errors in a big cancellation 
<li> Few PDGIDs were wrong sign in decays: Bugfix by Brian Peterson
<li> 3-loop RGEs and 2-loop corrections to gluino/sparticle masses now always compiled. 2-loop scalar RGEs used for RPC by default.
<li> Made quark mixing parameter MIXING an object parameter in MssmSusy object. Use setMixing() and displayMixing() methods. User-set electroweak symmetry breaking scale QEWSB now moved into MssmSoftsusy object: use setQewsb() and displayQewsb().
