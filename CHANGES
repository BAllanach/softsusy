<li>higgs->Z gamma corrected in NMSSM case - it was missing a contribution
<li>higgs->mu mu decays implemented with pole muon mass when the Yukawa coupling is zero
<li>H->WW* H->ZZ* decays have prefactors altered to hopefully include more higher order effects 
<li>Fixed problem that wasn't flagging the non-convergence of the fixed point iteration algorithm: thanks to A Ibrahim for finding it
<li>Made 0 mixing default (ie no quark mixing, but non-zero masses for second/third family)
