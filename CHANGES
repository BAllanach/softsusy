<li>05/07/16: M32 and m0 entries in command line input fixed for AMSB - thanks
to M Dolan
<li>06/07/16: Patch for numerical stability of B1 function. Thanks to A
Voigt. 
<li>06/07/16: Approximate 2-loop QCD corrections to top mass included when the full ones are not compiled to provide backwards compatibility with 3.7.0 or earlier. This was accidentally *switched off* in 3.7.1. It can make a huge difference to the location of the focus point or higgsino LSP region.
