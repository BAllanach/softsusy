1. 25/2/13 Modified fB function: sometimes it was giving large numerical
inaccuracies, if one used optimisation. This is now fixed. 
2. 25/2/13 Made W/Z tachyon flags. 
3. 26/2/13 Moved tadpoles to MssmSoftsusy object and fixed up Rpv REWSB
4. 5/3/13  Improved numerical accuracy of b0 loop function
5. 20/3/13 Fixed SLHA2 output of neutral fermion mixing in RPV case
6. 2/4/13: Added protection in 2x2 diagonalisation routines against negative
eigenvalues. Only prints out an error message if DISPLAY_ARRAY_BOUNDS is
switched on 
7 18/4/13: Bug-fixed slepton correction to slepton mass. Thanks to A Voigt.
