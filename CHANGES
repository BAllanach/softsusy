<li>Fixed discussion of Higgs decays in manual
<li>Got rid of approximate 2-loop running mt corrections: they have been causing inaccurate results since 3.7.4, decreasing mh by 4 GeV or so, for instance. For accurate mh determination, use ./configure --enable-two-loop-gauge-yukawa-compilation and SLHA higher-loop contribution flags. Thanks to T. Garon and L. Everett for pointing this out.
