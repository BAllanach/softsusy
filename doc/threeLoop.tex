\begin{abstract}
  Previous minimal supersymmetric standard model public spectrum calculators
  contain two-loop 
  renormalisation group equations and one-loop threshold corrections to the
  gauge and Yukawa couplings. Here, we explore the effects of three-loop
  renormalisation group equation terms, some leading two-loop threshold
  corrections are incorporated to the third family Yukawa couplings and the
  strong coupling constant.
  We illustrate our results in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard
  model (CMSSM). 
  At a generic CMSSM point, some of the sparticle masses change by around
  3$\%$ and the 
  lightest CP-even Higgs mass by around 2-3 GeV. 
  The changes can be much greater in the fixed point region of the CMSSM at
  high values of $m_0$, a region which has become more attractive, given the
  emprirical Higgs mass constraints. 
  We also provide detail on the
  approximations used. The additional higher order corrections have been
  incorporated into {\tt SOFTSUSY3.5.0}, and we provide details on how to
  compile and use the program.

\section{Introduction}

The recent discovery of the Higgs boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}
and the measurement of its mass at around 
125-126 GeV~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-014} solidify the important and well-known
question of how its mass is 
stabilised with respect to quantum corrections, which are expected to be of
order the largest fundamental mass scale divided by the 16$\pi^2$ loop factor.
In particular, the Planck mass at $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV from gravitational
corrections is expected to be the largest such relevant mass scale. 
However, since a quantum field theoretic description of gravity does not
exist it is possible, if not expected, that our effective field theory
description breaks down and such huge corrections are absent
for some reason. 
In any case, mass scales associated with the string scale $\sim 10^{17}$ GeV
or the GUT scale $\sim 10^{16}$ GeV reintroduce the question of stability of
the Higgs mass.  
Imposing softly-broken supersymmetry upon the Standard Model provides a
well-known answer to this question, and this approach has been pursued
with vigour in the literature and at various high energy colliders (see, for
example, Refs.~\cite{Aad:2013wta,Chatrchyan:2014lfa}), where 
the Standard Model particles' supersymmetric partners predicted are being
searched for. To date, no unambiguous direct collider signals of
supersymmetric particles have been found, and a significant portion of the
most interesting parameter space has been ruled out. 
In order to rule a parameter point out, one predicts sparticle masses using
a supersymmetric spectrum generator and then simulates various collisions,
comparing to data to see if the predicted signals are significantly excluded
or not (or conversely, to see if there is evidence statistically significant
enough to claim a signal).

There are currently several available sparticle generators: {\tt
  ISAJET}~\cite{Paige:2003mg}, {\tt 
  SOFTSUSY}~\cite{Allanach:2001kg,Allanach:2009bv,Allanach:2011de,Allanach:2013kza}, 
{\tt SPheno}~\cite{Porod:2003um},
{\tt SUSEFLAV}~\cite{Chowdhury:2011zr} and
{\tt SUSPECT}~\cite{Djouadi:2002ze}. Even specialising to the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with real parameters, 
they have slightly different
approximations, resulting in numerical predictions that are not
identical~\cite{Allanach:2003jw,Allanach:2004rh,Belanger:2005jk}. 
Even when calculations have at the same headline order of approximation (for
example, `two-loop RGEs and one-loop threshold corrections at $M_Z$),
legitimate differences can result from the fact that higher order corrections
contribute to the calculation implicitly in different ways. 
If we take the example of a one-loop threshold correction to, for example, 
the prediction of the stop mass, there are various contributions from Standard
Model and supersymmetric particles. If we consider an internal loop with
say a gluino propagator, which mass do we use for the gluino? One achieves
numerically distinct results if one uses two of the obvious choices: the
pole mass or the modified dimensional reduction ($\overline{DR}$) running
mass. The difference between the two prescriptions is a two-loop threshold
effect, and so either choice is allowed if one is working only at one loop.
Such choices occur hundreds of times within the calculation, multiplying the
poissibilities for numerical differences. Thus, the numerical differences
between the spectrum calculators gives a rough estimate of the size of
theoretical uncertainties associated with the calculation. 

The constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model makes a simplying
assumption about the supersymmetry breaking terms: each soft SUSY breaking
scalar mass is set to a common value $m_0$ at a high scale $M_{GUT}$, the
gaugino masses are set to a common value $M_{1/2}$ at $M_{GUT}$ and the 
SUSY breaking trilinear scalar couplings are all fixed to a value $A_0$ at
$M_{GUT}$. The other relevant parameters are $\tan \beta$, the ratio of the
two Higgs vacuum expectation values, and the sign of a parameter $\mu$ that
appears in the Higgs potential (its magnitude is fixed minimisation of the
Higgs potential in order to predict the empirically measured central value of
the $Z^0$ boson mass).

The obvious way to reduce such a theoretical uncertainty is to incorporate the
higher order effects, pushing the associated theoretical uncertainty to even
higher orders.
That is what we have done for the present paper: we have
picked some available higher order terms that are expected to affect the
predictions of the spectrum mass calculation, and included them in
{\tt SOFTSUSY3.5.0}. The previous version of the program, {\tt SOFTSUSY3.4.1}, 
contained two-loop RGEs and one-loop threshold corrections. 
The higher order terms that we have included are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Three-loop RGEs to all soft and supersymmetry preserving MSSM parameters, 
assuming that they are real. The supersymmetric parameters contain the
possibility of full three-family mixing. The three-loop contribution to the 
soft-breaking MSSM parameters are calculated in the dominant third family
approximation. 
\item
The following two-loop threshold corrections:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Name & Description \\ \hline
$\Delta m_t$ & $\mathcal O(\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to $m_t$ \\
 $\Delta \alpha_s$ & $\mathcal O(\alpha_s^2)$, $\mathcal O(\alpha_s Y_b^2)$,
 $\mathcal O(\alpha_s 
 Y_t^2)$ corrections to $\alpha_s$. \\
 $\Delta m_b, m_\tau$ & $\mathcal O(\alpha_s^2)$, $\mathcal O(\alpha_s Y_b^2)$, $\mathcal O(\alpha_s
 Y_b^2)$ corrections to $m_b$. Also included are $\mathcal O(Y_\tau^4)$
 corrections to $m_\tau$. \\
\hline \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
Here, $\alpha_s$ denotes the strong coupling constant, $m_t$ the top mass,
$Y_b$ the bottom Yukawa coupling, $Y_t$ the top Yukawa coupling and $Y_\tau$
the tau Yukawa coupling. 
None of $\Delta m_t$, $\Delta \alpha_s$ or $\Delta m_b, m_\tau$ have been, to
the best of our knowledge, made available to the public in a supported
computer program before. 

The effect of the three-loop RGEs upon the relative mass shifts 
of Snowmass (SPS) benchmark 
points~\cite{Allanach:2002nj} were presented and studied in 
Ref.~\cite{Jack:2004ch} 
without the inclusion of the two-loop threshold effects. 
The three-loop RGEs are enhanced by a large logarithm $\log M_{GUT}/M_Z$,
which effectively promotes them to the size of a two-loop threshold effect. 
Thus the additional higher order terms that were included in
Ref.~\cite{Jack:2004ch} were of the same order of other terms that were
missing in the calculation. Effects upon sparticle mass predictions of around
1-2$\%$ were typically found, although one point studied did have an 8$\%$
difference in the light stop mass at the SPS5 point. 
We go beyond this calculation by including the threshold effects, which are of
the same order as the three-loop effects.

Subsequently, one of us performed~\cite{Bednyakov:2010ni} a preliminary study
of the SPS 4 (CMSSM high
$\tan \beta$) benchmark
point~\cite{Allanach:2002nj}, with a modified version of {\tt SOFTSUSY} that
included both three-loop RGEs and the two-loop thresholds that we consider
here. 1-2$\%$ mass shifts in the strongly interacting sparticles, a 3$\%$
correction to the higgsino mass and a 1$\%$ decrease in the lightest CP even
higgs boson mass was observed. 

Our purpose here is to provide a more extensive
study of the higher order effects as well as to present a public version of {\tt
  SOFTSUSY} that incorporates them, along with instructions on how to use it.
We go beyond the pioneering study Ref.~\cite{Bednyakov:2010ni} in the
following ways: in section~\ref{sec:results}, we show case the effect of the
higher order terms in a CMSSM  
focus-point, where a high sensitivity to the precise value of the top Yukawa
coupling leads to large changes order one in the mass spectrum. 
We also study the concomitant effects on the predicted relic density of
dark matter.
We then present a detailed
breakdown in the case of a phenomenological MSSM point, where the effects of
the RGEs are 
small, allowing us to focus, to a reasonable approximation, purely on the size
of the threshold corrections. We then quantify the effects of the higher order
corrections in a CMSSM plane that is used by ATLAS to interpret their searches
for supersymmetric particles in order to get an idea of the size of the
corrections for generic points in parameter space that are not excluded by the
current experimental limits. 
We scan a high $\tan \beta$ CMSSM plane to illustrate the large effect that the
higher order terms can have upon the dark matter relic density prediction,
across parameter space. 
We also study the improvement in scale dependence
of the MSSM particle pole masses.  
In the appendix, we give details on how to install and use the increased
accuracy mode in a publicly available version of {\tt SOFTSUSY}.

\end{table}
In Table~\ref{tab:cmssm}, we show the effects of the higher order terms for a
CMSSM parameter point that is in the high $\tan \beta$ focus point region:
($m_0=7130$ GeV, $M_{1/2}=800$ GeV, $A_0=-6000$ GeV,
$\tan \beta=50$, sign $\mu>0$) with 
rather attractive properties: it has a high lightest CP even Higgs mass of
122.3 GeV, within $1\sigma$ of the experimental
central value, once theoretical uncertainties (estimated to be around $\pm3$
GeV~\cite{Allanach:2004rh}) 
have been taken into account.
It also has attractive dark matter properties: $\Omega_{CDM} h^2=0.099$ is
close to the central value inferred from cosmological observations. Aside from
that, the gluino and squark masses are heavy enough so as to not be ruled out
by the LHC7/8 TeV data. Apart from these phenomenologically advantageous
properties, the point has a high value of $\tan \beta=50$, which may give the 
bottom and tau Yukawa corrections a higher impact than if $\tan \beta$ were
smaller (at higher values of $\tan \beta$, the bottom and tau Yukawa couplings
are roughly proportional to $\tan \beta$).
We split the various higher order corrections up in
the table: the `base' calculation is always considered to be {\tt
  SOFTSUSY3.4.1}, which does not contain the higher order corrections. 
We see that the row $\Delta m_t$, that includes 2-loop threshold corrections
to $m_t$ coming from strong SUSY QCD corrections only contains `N/A' entries,
indicating that the calculation failed in this approximation because
electroweak symmetry was not broken successfully. {\bf EWSB equation}.
At the focus point,
the predicted value of $\mu$ derived from electroweak symmetry breaking is
known to 
depend extremely sensitively upon the precise value of the top Yukawa
coupling. 
The parameter point appears to agree with the experimental result on the Higgs
mass (which, in the CMSSM at high masses, acts to a good approximation with
identical couplings to the Standard Model Higgs)
to within the one 1$\sigma$ level according to the {\tt SOFTSUSY3.4.1}
calculation. However, one would discard the point based on the predicted value
of 95 for $\Omega_{CDM} h^2$, which disagrees with the cosmologically inferred
value by hundreds of sigma. On the other hand, including all of the high order
corrections (`$\Delta$ All'), we see that the Higgs mass lowers somewhat, and
the dark matter 
relic density is predicted to be the cosmologically acceptable value of 0.99
once all of the higher order corrections are included.
The two-loop threshold corrections to the bottom and tau Yukawa couplings 
have a very small effect: smaller than 0.1 GeV for most of the sparticle
masses, despite the fact that the Yukawa couplings themselves are of order the
top Yukawa coupling. 
Two-loop threshold corrections to the strong gauge coupling have a significant
effect upon some of the sparticle masses: particularly $m_{\chi_3^0}$ and
$m_{\chi_4^0}$. {\bf neutralino mass equation}.
These two masses are controlled to leading order by $\mu$,
which in turn is affected sensitively by the top Yukawa coupling. 
The top Yukawa coupling is changed by the different value of $\alpha_s$
through renormalisation group effects. {\bf one-loop $Y_t$ RGE}.

  shows the number of loops used in the MSSM RGEs. }
\end{table}
We now wish to decouple the three-loop RGE effects from the two-loop threshold
effects as far as possible while still giving a valid prediction for a point
in MSSM parameter space. This can be achieved by studying the spectrum from a
point in phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) parameter space, where supersymmetry
breaking 
boundary conditions are imposed already at the SUSY breaking scale, defined to 
be $\sqrt{m_{{\tilde t}_1} m_{{\tilde t}_2}}$. We use the point pMSSM1.6 from
Ref.~\cite{AbdusSalam:2011fc}, which is defined to have all scalar trilinear
couplings 0, the first two generation squark mass, 
the tree-level bino and gluino masses all set to 800 GeV and a tree-level gluino
mass of 960 GeV. The tree-level wino mass, $\mu$ and the pseudoscalar Higgs
pole mass and all other tree-level squark and slepton masses are fixed to 2500
GeV. The aim of using the pMSSM is to reduce the effects of the RGEs in order
to study the threshold contributions more cleanly. However, we cannot
eliminate RGE effects completely because there is still running between 
$M_Z$ and $M_{SUSY} \sim 2.5$ TeV, however they are small, being of order
$1/(16 \pi^2) \log M_{SUSY}/M_Z$, i.e.\ not enhanced by large logarithms,
unlike the CMSSM case above. 
We see that the lightest CP-even Higgs mass prediction decreases by 2.1 GeV,
mainly because of the  corrections to the top mass. The high order strong
corrections to $\alpha_s$ reduce
squark and gluino masses at the per-mille level, which will only have a very
small effect on collider signatures. 
We see that the RGE corrections do induce a small additional change: but it is
at the per-mille or smaller level for this point.
The sparticle mass predictions only change by a
very small amount, which is contrary to the case of the focus-point CMSSM
(which is 
admittedly very sensitive to small changes in the top Yukawa coupling) that is
shown in Table~\ref{tab:cmssm}. However, we shall show next that even for more
generic CMSSM points, there are typically changes in the spectra of 2-3$\%$.
We conclude that in this point of the pMSSM, the higher order effects are not
needed for collider studies except for those involving the lightest CP-even
Higgs. We find it likely, where no input mass parameters are lighter
than 700 GeV that this conclusion will hold more generally for the
pMSSM because of sparticle decoupling in the corrections. 
Obviously, to be sure of this conclusion, one should check the point's
robustness with respect to the higher order effects. 

\subsection{CMSSM parameter scans}

We now perform a scan over CMSSM parameter space in order to examine the kind
of behaviour expected more generically from the higher order corrections, and
also to foretell possible effects on SUSY phenomenology. We choose the
$m_0-M_{1/2}$ plane with $\mu>0$, $\tan \beta=30$ and $A_0=-2m_0$, which was
recently used by ATLAS to place bounds upon the CMSSM from various 8
TeV,  LHC jets plus missing energy
searches~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-047,Aad:2013wta} with 20 fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity.  
We have combined the two most restrictive exclusion limits into one: if a
point is excluded by either or both of them, we count it as excluded. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:cmssm}, we show some contours of important MSSM particle
masses as 
well as their relative change due to the higher order corrections. The region
below the dashed line is excluded by either one or both of the most
restrictive ATLAS SUSY searches~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-047,Aad:2013wta}. 
We see that the gluino, the lightest CP even Higgs mass, the first two
generation average squark mass and
the CP odd Higgs mass $m_A$ typically becomes reduced by
1-3$\%$ by the higher order corrections in the region allowed by the search. 
In the CMSSM, the dominant production of SUSY particles is via gluino and 
squark production. The reduction of gluino and squark masses change the SUSY
production cross-section {\bf INVESTIGATE}.
The mass of the lightest neutralino changes less: typically at the one
per-mille level, whereas the lightest stop mass has larger contributions from
the higher order corrections: up to about $\pm 8\%$. CMSSM signatures involving
the lightest stops are therefore more sensitive to the higher order
contributions.

	\item[] \verb|--enable-three-loop-rge-compilation| - compile three-loop RGEs in the MSSM 
	\item[] \verb|--enable-full-susy-threshold-compilation| - compile
          additional two-loop threshold corrections to the third generation
          Yukawa couplings and the strong coupling constant.
\end{itemize}

Boolean variables that control the Increased Accuracy Mode at runtime
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|USE_THREE_LOOP_RGE = false|  - add three-loop contribution to MSSM RGE (corresponds to the \code{SOFTSUSY Block} parameter 19)
	\item \verb|USE_TWO_LOOP_THRESHOLD = false| - add two-loop threshold corrections to the third generation Yukawa couplings and the strong coupling constant
(corresponds to the \code{SOFTSUSY Block} parameter 20)
\end{itemize}

Additional variables that gives a finer control the Increased Accuracy Mode at runtime (with their default values)
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|double TWOLOOP_NUM_THRESH = 0.1|  - used in the iterative algorithm to prevent lengthy re-evaluation of two-loop thresholds 
		if the relative difference between the result obtained in current step and the  calcululated previously is less than \verb|TWOLOOP_NUM_THRESH| 
	\item \verb|boolean SOFTSUSY_TWOLOOP_blah = true| - control whether individual two-loop threshold corrections should be added (remove it or make a \verb|enum|?)
	\item \verb|boolean MB_DECOUPLING = false| - evaluate b-quark self-energies at $p=0$ in order to incorporate ``decoupling'' precedure (remove it?)
\end{itemize}


\section{Running \SOFTSUSY in the Increased Accuracy Mode} 
\label{sec:run}

\SOFTSUSY~produces an executable called \code{softpoint.x}. For the calculation
of the spectrum of single points in parameter space, we recommend the
SUSY Les Houches Accord 2 (SLHA2)~\cite{Allanach:2008qq}  input/output
option. The user must provide a file (e.g.\ the example file included
in the \SOFTSUSY~distribution
\code{rpvHouchesInput}), that specifies the model dependent input
parameters. The program may then be run with
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 ./softpoint.x leshouches < inOutFiles/lesHouchesInput
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

One can change whether the 3-loop RGE corrections are switched on with
\code{SOFTSUSY Block} parameter 19, whereas the 2-loop third family and $g_3$
threshold corrections 
are switched on with \code{SOFTSUSY Block} parameter 20 in the SLHA2 input file:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
Block SOFTSUSY               # Optional SOFTSUSY-specific parameters
   19   1.000000000e+00      # Include 3-loop RGE terms (0 to disable)
   20   1.000000000e+00      # Include 2-loop thresholds (0 to disable)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
